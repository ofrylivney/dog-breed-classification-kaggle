# dog-breed-classification-kaggle
# Issues 
###### Dog breed training.ipynb runs but aagain runs out of time. 
So it became very difficult to train the data from kaggle as Goggle collaborator would run out of time. Few times it did train but was not successfull all the time. 
###### So there is another file which already has the data for validation test (just for the test), so that it would, atleast run. 
###### The data from kaggle is trained using validation data that was found on internet from sources. 
######  Keras is used for the training of data
